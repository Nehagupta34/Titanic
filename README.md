# Titanic: Who will survive ML model
In this project, we were given with the passengers name, age, gender, socio-economic, class, etc. We have to create a model that has to predict who has more chances of surviving the sinking titanic.
So, I have done this project by taking the help of kaggle. I have downloaded the dataset from kaggle.
